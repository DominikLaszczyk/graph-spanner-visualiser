# Graph Spanner Tool

Welcome to the Graph Spanner Tool repository! This tool allows you to manipulate graphs, calculate graph spanners, and visualize the spanner creation process. Whether you're a student studying graph algorithms or a researcher in the field, this tool can help you understand and experiment with various graph spanner algorithms.

## Features

- **Manipulate Graphs:** Add/remove nodes/edges, modify edge weights.
- **Calculate Spanners:** Compute graph spanners using various algorithms.
- **Algorithm Selection:** Choose from four different spanner calculation algorithms.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive UI with clear instructions and feedback.
- **Visualization:** Visualize the spanner creation process.
- **Optimization:** Opt-out of visualization for better performance.

## Supported Algorithms

- **Kruskal's MST algorithm**
- **Greedy t-spanner algorithm**
- **Randomised Edge Sampling algorithm**
- **Proto Clustering and Path Buying algorithm**
